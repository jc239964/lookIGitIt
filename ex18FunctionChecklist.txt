FUNCTION CHECKLIST

DEFINING
1.) Did you start your function definition with 'def'?
2.) Does your function name have only characters and _ characters?
3.) Did you put an open parenthesis '(' right after the function name?
4.) Did you put your arguments after the parenthesis '(' separated by commas?
5.) Did you make each argument unique? (Meaning, no duplicated names.)
6.) Did you put a close parenthesis and a colon ':' after the arguments? 
7.) Did you indent all lines of code you want in the function four spaces?
8.) Did you end your function by going back to writing with no indent?
	(The technical term for this is 'dedenting'.)

CALLING
1.) Did you call/use/run this function by typing its name?
2.) Did you put the ( character after the name to run it?
3.) Did you put the values you want into the parenthesis separated by commas?
	(i.e. were the arguments defined?)
4.) Did you end the function call with a ) character?

Do not forget: "To 'run,' 'call,' or 'use' a function all mean the same thing.
